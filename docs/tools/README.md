# Tools

We've organized the tools in this toolbox within a framework of three main _phases_, each with several _areas of focus_. Click through to a tool to find info on ...

* how to use it
* its level of time commitment and difficulty
* the materials you'll need
* where it might be of best use

## üîé **Problem seeking**

**Landscape:** Research the current state of solutions (or lack thereof) from the user's perspective

* [Content audit](content-audit.md)
* [Heuristic evaluation](heuristic-evaluation.md)
* [Primary research (aka user research)](primary-research.md)
* [Secondary research (aka contextual/competitive/tech research)](secondary-research.md)
* [Sitemap](sitemap.md)

**Empathize:** Discover users' primary use cases, typical journeys, pain points, and ideal end states

* [Empathy interview](empathy-interview.md)
* [Empathy map](empathy-map.md)
* [I like, I wish, what if](like-wish-what.md)
* [Journey map](journey-map.md)
* [Mind map](mind-map.md)
* [Resource flow](resource-flow.md)
* [Use cases (and user stories, "hills", etc)](use-cases.md)

**Synthesize:** Group users according to the most appropriate axes for the problem and use those groups for guidance going forward

* [Personas](personas.md)

## üé® **Problem shaping**

**Diverge:** Brainstorm, think outside the box, come up with ideas, pain points, opportunities and potential directions

* [Brainstorming](brainstorming.md)
* [Five "why"s](five-whys.md)
* [How might we](how-might-we.md)
* [Mind map](mind-map.md)
* [SCAMPER](scamper.md)

**Converge:** Find patterns, synthesize, find insights toward solutions or opportunities for change

* [Business model canvas](business-model-canvas.md)
* [Co-creation session (aka design studio)](co-creation.md)
* [Collating, clustering and voting](collating-clustering-voting.md)
* [Crazy eights](crazy-eights.md)
* [Insight statements](insight-statements.md)
* [Principle definition](principle-definition.md)
* [Problem framing and reframing](problem-framing-reframing.md)
* [Storyboard](storyboard.md)

**Align:** Decide on one (or several) directions for prototyping and testing and define success for each of them

* [Collating, clustering and voting](collating-clustering-voting.md)
* [Solution definition](solution-definition.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Problem solving**

**Prototype:** Create a "minimum believable product" that enables you to test in ways that measure a solution's success

* [High-fidelity prototype](high-fidelity-prototype.md)
* [Low-fidelity prototype](low-fidelity-prototype.md)

**Test:** Evaluate your prototype with real humans (or anything else you‚Äôve created earlier in the process) and measure its performance against your definition of success

* [A/B testing](a-b-test.md)
* [Analytics (aka passive quantitative testing)](analytics.md)
* [Card sorting](card-sorting.md)
* [Moderated testing (aka interview-based testing)](moderated-testing.md)
* [Sponsor users](/tools/sponsor-users)
* [Tree testing](tree-testing.md)
* [Unmoderated testing](unmoderated-testing.md)
