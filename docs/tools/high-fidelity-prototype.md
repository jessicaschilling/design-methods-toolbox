# High Fidelity Prototype

### _Phase:_ üõ†Ô∏è  Problem solving<br/> _Focus:_ Prototype

::: tip IN BRIEF
**Time commitment:** 2 or more days, depending on complexity of prototype  
**Difficulty:** Moderate/difficult  
**Materials needed:** Prototyping tools (Sketch, InVision, Adobe XD, etc), feedback forum (physical or virtual)  
**Who should participate:** User experience designers, visual designers, product/project owners, developers  
**Best for:** Iterating on low-fidelity prototypes and preparing for user testing

## About this tool

High-fidelity prototypes represent some of the final stages in the prototyping and testing process; you've moved through enough satisfactory iterations at a [lower level of detail](low-fidelity-prototype.md) that you're almost ‚Äî but not quite ‚Äî ready to create a production build. High-fidelity prototypes are close enough to reality that it's sometimes difficult to tell the difference; often, this can be a negative in terms of those who test your prototypes not understanding that information and presentation is still entirely malleable, but this can actually be a plus at the end stage of a prototyping exercise because it enables you to glean testers' insights with a great degree of applicability fo the final product. (This does mean that your testers will be more likely to comment on superficial details ‚Äî which is hopefully desirable at this point in your process!)

Because they're so close to "done", high-fidelity prototypes move past tools such as PowerPoint and pen/paper to include the polished look (including colors, fonts, branding, and imagery) facilitated by tools such as Sketch, InVision, or even working directly in code. As a result, they usually take much longer to build than low-fidelity prototypes, and your team does run the risk of being reluctant to consider major changes as a result. With this in mind, move to high-fidelity prototyping only when you're reasonably sure that you won't undergo significant rework of fundamental concepts ‚Äî or if your testing does call for this later, be willing to accept the need for change.

Finally, remember that even when you're at the high-fidelity stage, prototypes can still fail ‚Äî and that's OK. If you're in a position of leadership or in direct influence of leadership, be sure to continue to convey the message that even "failed" prototypes represent progress.
