# Collating, Clustering, and Voting

### _Phase:_ ðŸŽ¨ Problem shaping<br/> _Focus:_ Converge, align

::: tip IN BRIEF
**Time commitment:** A few minutes to a few hours, depending on complexity of material being evaluated  
**Difficulty:** Moderate  
**Materials needed:** Insights, problems or other items to be synthesized, meeting space (physical or virtual), voting mechanism if needed (physical dot stickers, virtual emoji voting, etc), participants from a variety of technical and cultural perspectives (the more of these, the more useful)  
**Who should participate:** User experience designers, visual designers, product/project owners, community specialists, developers, and/or users  
**Best for:** Synthesizing and ranking diverse information in order to enable decisions about next steps

## About this tool

Collating, clustering and voting aren't so much tools in themselves as they are techniques that enable a wide range of other tools in this toolkit. To that end, we've gathered a number of approaches to collating, clustering and voting here.

### Approaches for collating, clustering and synthesizing

* [Synthesizing insights from user interviews](https://medium.com/design-research-methods/design-research-from-interview-to-insight-part-one-summarising-the-interview-dceee9ba0969): Tips for moving from conversational notes to more concrete insights. This guide talks specifically about synthesizing feedback gathered during user interviews, but can also work well when summarizing a variety of opinion-based exercises.
* [Using affinity diagrams](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/affinity-diagrams-learn-how-to-cluster-and-bundle-ideas-and-facts) to cluster brief notes from brainstorms, mental maps and similar activities
* [Idea bundling](https://www.designkit.org/methods/bundle-ideas): Like affinity diagramming, but with the addition of more formal, overarching themes
* ["Ways to grow" framework](https://www.designkit.org/methods/ways-to-grow-framework) for clustering potential solutions on a matrix of novelty versus user expertise
* [A workshop recipe](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/workshops-to-establish-empathy-and-understanding-from-user-research-results) for when more in-depth, synchronous analysis and synthesis of user research results is helpful
* [Creating broad concepts](https://www.designkit.org/methods/create-a-concept) from already-clustered insights or proposed solutions

### Approaches for voting

* [How to do dot voting more effectively](http://dotmocracy.org/dot-voting/)
* [Guide to a wide variety of other voting ideas](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-select-the-best-idea-by-the-end-of-an-ideation-session), including dot voting, the Four Categories method (ranking on rationality, delight, and more), the "now/wow/how" matrix, the Six Thinking Hats method, and others.

### All-in-one

* [The KJ method](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/kj-method/) combines collating, clustering and voting into a single exercise
