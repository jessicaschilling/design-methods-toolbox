### _Phase:_ ðŸ”Ž Problem seeking<br/> _Focus:_ Landscape

::: tip IN BRIEF
**Time commitment:** Varying according to scope of research needed, but slightly time-intensive  
**Difficulty:** Easy/medium  
**Materials needed:** Good Google-fu and potentially licenses for similar/competing solutions to yours  
**Who should participate:** User experience designers, project/product owners, anyone  
**Best for:** A first-level investigation into the current state of a problem's landscape and the potential for product-market fit

## About this tool

While direct work with your users themselves should take the fore in your problem-seeking research into the current landscape of solutions (or lack thereof), much can also be gleaned from "desk work": Investigating the overall technical and product landscape to assess direct competitors, related products or services, basic market opportunity, and overall potential for product-market fit for your solution. When combined with [primary research](primary-research.md) conducted directly with users, insights from this secondary research can put you well on the way to understanding the overall landscape of your problem/opportunity and prepare you for digging into user journeys, pain points, ideal states, and other empathetic work.

When conducting secondary research, consider questions such as the following:

* Are there other players out there already trying to solve the problem you want to solve? To what degree have they succeeded?
* Are there holes in competitors' approaches that we can exploit â€” can we take a different approach to deliver something uniquely valuable?
* Is there a variety of target markets or audiences for your problem, or would you be catering to a narrow niche?
* Are there already established conventions, methods or protocols for approaching the problem you want to solve? Can you improve on existing best practices?
* Has your problem been tackled by others in the past, but failed? Why?
* Are there (even somewhat) analogous problems in other industries that have already been solved? How?
* Are there innovations in your problem space that were abandoned or never elaborated upon? Can you find (or guess at) the reasons why?
