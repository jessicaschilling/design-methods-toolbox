## About this tool

The business model canvas is a tool typically used more often when strategizing on high-level ideation on a company idea, but it can also be very helpful in user experience design as a tool for keeping business viability or product-market fit at top of mind when ideating on potential solutions. It's a [templated sheet](https://canvanizer.com/downloads/business_model_canvas_poster.pdf) for fleshing out business ideas based on the following parameters:

* Key partners
* Key activities
* Key resources
* Value propositions
* Customer relationships
* Customer segments
* Communications and distribution channels
* Cost structure
* Revenue streams

When conducting a business model canvas workshop, it's possible for the entire time to complete one template together, but you'll usually get more varied insight by asking each individual to fill out one or more templates and then discuss them together as a group. Then, you can [combine the best aspects of each](collating-clustering-voting.md) into a master canvas that you can then use to make decisions on your next steps or determine potential [solutions](solution-definition.md) you may wish to [prototype](low-fidelity-prototype.md).
