# Heuristic Evaluation

### _Phase:_ ðŸ”Ž Problem seeking<br/> _Focus:_ [Landscape](/tools/#landscape)

::: tip IN BRIEF
**Time commitment:** Varies by size of site, but relatively time-intensive  
**Difficulty:** Low  
**Materials needed:** Website/app to audit, qualitative/quantitative information about your users such as  [personas](personas.md) and usage metrics, spreadsheet  
**Who should participate:** User experience designers, visual designers, project/product owners, developers  
**Best for:** Gaining an initial view of a product's overall usability in order to assess needs and next steps

## About this tool

Heuristic evaluation can be an excellent first-step analysis of an existing artifact because it's relatively simple: Gather a small group of diverse evaluators to examine whether the product stacks up to recognized usability principles (heuristics). If you've got a site, app or other artifact that already exists and is heading for its next version, this can be a good place to start, often in conjunction with creating a [sitemap](sitemap.md) and doing a [content audit](content-audit.md) in order to assemble a complete picture of current state.

While different types of products or areas of focus may lend themselves to "specialty" heuristics, the UX community generally agrees that Nielsen Norman Group's [10 usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) are a good place to start.

* Gather a small group of reviewers (3-8 people or so); they can be internal, but take care to make sure they're not too close to the product, and that they represent a diverse group of viewpoints and areas of expertise.
* Give them a list of usability heuristics (perhaps NN's canonical ones, personalized and augmented by anything suggested by your qual/quant knowledge of your users) and ask them to note down in a central spreadsheet or other convenient location how the product does or does not meet these principles.
* Group their responses by principle and look for patterns or clusters that may indicate relative importance/severity or prioritization of work needed. Summarize your findings in a format that can help others take action upon your next steps.

Be aware that while heuristic review can provide a substantial amount of insight with a minimum of effort and expense, it shouldn't be considered a replacement for interview-based [moderated usability testing](moderated-testing.md); a heuristic review is limited to a fixed set of criteria, and will fail to surface the nuanced insights that usability testing will provide.
