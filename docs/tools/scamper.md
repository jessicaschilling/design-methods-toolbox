## About this tool

While most of the elements of the SCAMPER framework have been explained elsewhere in this toolbox (particularly in [problem framing and reframing](problem-framing-reframing.md)), SCAMPER can be a useful rubric for combining many of them into a single exercise useful for becoming "unstuck". Each letter stands for a different exercise that may be helpful in the event of a creative impasse:

* Substitute: Are there elements of our product/service that we can substitute for others?
* Combine: Can we combine our product/service with others, either our own or someone else's?
* Adapt: What ideas from elsewhere can we alter or adapt?
* Maximize or minimize: Would significantly enlarging or reducing any aspect of our effort make a significant impact in how we approach it?
* Put to other use: Are there any significantly "off-label" uses for our product that we haven't considered yet? Do we need to?
* Eliminate: Are there elements of the product/service that can be eliminated entirely?
* Rearrange or reverse: How might we rearrange the product or reverse the process?
