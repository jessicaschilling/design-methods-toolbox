## In brief

This toolbox is an open-source reference intended to help you explore how doing design strategy, research and testing can improve your day-to-day work life â€” and help us all build better stuff for the users we're striving to serve. It includes a wide set of tools for _problem seeking_, _problem shaping_ and _problem solving_, with how-to summaries and resources for learning more.

The best way to explore this toolbox is to visit its website, [designmethodstoolbox.com](https://designmethodstoolbox.com)

It's built in [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and deployed via [Netlify](https://designmethodstoolbox.netlify.app/).
