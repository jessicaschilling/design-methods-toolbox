**A resource for builders and doers who want to design with intention**

## In brief

This toolbox is an open-source reference intended to help you explore how doing design strategy, research and testing can improve your day-to-day work life â€” and help us all build better stuff for the users we're striving to serve. It includes a wide set of tools for _problem seeking_, _problem shaping_ and _problem solving_, with how-to summaries and resources for learning more.

It was originally created as an in-house project for [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai), but they're a bunch of great folks who believe in open source.

**The best way to explore this toolbox is to visit its website, [designmethodstoolbox.com](https://designmethodstoolbox.com).**

It's built in [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) because Vuepress is nifty.
